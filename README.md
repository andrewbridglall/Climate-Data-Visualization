_Authors: Andrew Bridglall, Ariel Calver, Nikhil Wadhwa, Sean Melville_

## Description

This application aims to simulate an interactive climate change visualization from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/). This visualization displays the global temperature anomalies in Celsius for every month from 1880 to 2016 with a line plot and bar plot. Gradations of red and blue represent positive and negative annual mean temperature anomalies, respectively. A bolded line indicates the mean temperature anomaly for the selected year. A horizontal dashed line represents the record-holding mean temperature anomaly year in the range of years selected.
